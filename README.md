# Fetch API GET Method - Example Website

This project demonstrates how to use the Fetch API's `GET` method to retrieve data from a server and display it on a webpage. The website dynamically fetches and presents the data in a simple, user-friendly layout.

## Features
- **Fetch Data**: Retrieves data from an external API using JavaScript's Fetch API.
- **Dynamic Content Display**: Displays the fetched data on the page in a structured format.
- **Basic Error Handling**: Notifies users if the data could not be retrieved.
- **Minimal UI**: Clean and simple design to focus on the functionality of the API call.

## Live Demo
You can visit the live version of the website here: [Fetch API GET Method Example](https://aarshpatel1.github.io/fetch-api-get-method/)

## Project Structure
The project consists of a single HTML page that includes JavaScript for fetching and displaying the data.

```
.
├── index.html         # Main HTML page
└── script.js          # JavaScript file for Fetch API implementation
```

## How It Works
1. **Fetch Data**: The JavaScript file contains a function that uses the `fetch()` method to send a GET request to an API endpoint.
2. **Display Data**: Once the data is retrieved, it is dynamically displayed on the webpage.
3. **Error Handling**: If the request fails, an error message is shown to the user.

## Usage
### Clone the Repository
To use this project on your local machine:

## Technologies Used
